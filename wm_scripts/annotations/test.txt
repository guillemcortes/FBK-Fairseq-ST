And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night.
And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. (Laughter)
(Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane! (Laughter) (Applause)
I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.
(Laughter) It's a true story — every bit of this is true.
Soon after Tipper and I left the — (Mock sob) White House — (Laughter) we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. (Laughter)
(Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me.
There was no motorcade back there. (Laughter) You've heard of phantom limb pain? (Laughter)
(Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat.
We were on I-40.
